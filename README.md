# Python Debugging - pdb

# Task 2

Below you have a fizz buz application that is buggy - fix it but before you do, try to use pdb to investigate

```
def fizzbuzz(maximum_value):
    for n in range(maximum_value):
        if n % 3 == 0:
            print('Fizz')
        elif n % 5 == 0:
            print('Buzz')
        elif n % 5 == 0 and n % 3 == 0:
            print('FizzBuzz')
        else:
            print(n)
```

### Recap

**What is the fizzbuzz algorithm?**

_It is a function that prints out "Fizz" when a number is a multiple of 3, prints out "Buzz" when a number is a mutliple of 5, if the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" gets printed, otherwise you can optionally print the value of the number (usually we loop over a range of numbers when answering this question)_

## Steps for your experiment

- Use `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` to help determine what could be wrong about this function

## Task 3

## Find the n'th number in the fibonacci sequence

_The Fibonaccic sequence is defined as follows. The first number of the sequence
is 0, the second number of the sequence is 1 and the following numbers in the sequence (n) are the sum of the previous 2 numbers before it._

The following function is provided as starter code for exploring

- Print out the values being memoized in a set

```
# This function returns values quite fast O(n) time or O(n) space, it also has an error
def get_n(n, memoize={1: 0, 2: 1}):
    if n in memoize:
        memoize[n]
    else:
        memoize[n] = get_n(n - 1, memoize) + get_n(n-2, memoize)
    return memoize[n]
```
